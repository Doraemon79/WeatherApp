# WeatherApp

The project works.
Since I am not used to start web application from scratch I used a web page as model.
-I made some basic unit tests (see picture “Test”), I used them to start the  coding;
- In order to have it work properly it is necessary to open the solution properties, check the multiple start projects box and set all 3 non test projects to start (see picture “Start Properties”);
-the application starts 3 pages,
-if you do not set speed or temperature it opens an error message;
-if you do not set a location it opens an error message;
-If one of the API is down it opens an error message;
-It works (see picture Results, I called my parents, I can confirm that in Rome it is warm)
-Considering there are just 2 APIs there is not much I can use dependency injection with.
-I am very tired but happy (see picture “I look Professional”)




!! I do not know the exact reason but the APIs are frequently down. !!


Minor personal notes:
-I changed computer last week and I spent Tuesday installing Visual Studio Community and .Net Core Tools,  I bought this laptop on Ebay.de and I am still getting used to the German keyboard, reliable but very tough to befriend.
-I am usually faster but I usually do not work at night;
-I am practically a novice at web development, my professional experience is with industrial machines.
